# NBA Draft Analysis

![main](images/draft.jpg)

This is a continuation of my series of learning to use different algorithms in R and learning more about the Tidymodels package, and its various uses.

## About the Data

The data set used comes for Kaggle.com, a great source of finding all kinds of data sets for data visualization and analysis. The data contains various statistics for all the NBA players drafted into the league from 1989 to 2021. It is a fairly tidy data set and requires little to none data clean in most of the cases to use for analysis.

## Data Information 


The dataset contains all NBA Draft picks from 1989-2021. Dataset consists of year, overall pick and player data.

Notable players: LeBron James, Kobe Bryant, Derrick Rose, Dirk Nowitzki, Carmelo Anthony, Stephen Curry, Paul Pierce, Kevin Durant, Shaq, Vince Carter, Allen Iverson

## Motivation

As stated earlier, my primary motivation for this blog post is learning how to use various methods of clustering data to find relationship between different players and their careers, and look at how closely those careers might be related, and potentially what influences such relations. 

Each of the alogrithms/methods use work in a slightly different way, primarily unsupervised and it should hopefully show the differences in which all players are related. Furthermore, these differences will also be method dependent and hopefully interesting to a basketball or a NBA fan. 

## Algorithms used

Some of the methods I hope to use in this blog post include:

- PCA
- UMAP
- T-SNE
- KNN


## Packages Used

For all of the aforementioned algorithms, R-code was used to carry out the analysis. 

Some of the R-packages used for data analysis as well as data modelling include:

- TidyModels - for PCA, UMAP and KNN
- TidyVerse - for data wrangling, data tidying
- RTSNE - for T-SNE


## Data Analysis

### Loading and Looking at the data

Data is available in a CSV format, and can be read and looked at using the readR package in R

#### Loading Libraries
```{r}
library(tidyverse)

```

#### Loading the CSV file

```{r}
nba <- read_csv("/Users/karatatiwantsinghsidhu/Google Drive/Code/GitHub/karat_codes/posts/nba-clustering/data/nbaplayersdraft.csv")

nba  |>  as_tibble()
```
