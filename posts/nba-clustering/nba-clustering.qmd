# NBA Draft Analysis

![main](images/draft.jpg)

This is a continuation of my series of learning to use different algorithms in R and learning more about the Tidymodels package, and its various uses.

## About the Data

The data set used comes for Kaggle.com, a great source of finding all kinds of data sets for data visualization and analysis. The data contains various statistics for all the NBA players drafted into the league from 1989 to 2021. It is a fairly tidy data set and requires little to none data clean in most of the cases to use for analysis.

## Motivation

As stated earlier, my primary motivation for this blog post is learning how to use various methods of clustering data to find relationship between different players and their careers, and look at how closely those careers might be related, and potentially what influences such relations. 

## Algorithms used

Some of the methods I hope to use in this blog post include:

- PCA
- UMAP
- T-SNE
- KNN


## Packages Used

For all of the aforementioned algorithms, R-code was used to carry out the analysis. 

Some of the R-packages used for data analysis as well as data modelling include:

- TidyModels
- TidyVerse
- RTSNE
