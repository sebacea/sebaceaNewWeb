# Karat Sidhu's Portfolio

**personal website repo. made with quarto, deployed using netlify + google domains.**

## I use the entire webpage:

- as an online business card,
- for people to have a quick & convenient place to get in touch with me
- so people can get familiar with my qualifications and experience and;
- for journalizing/learning things I am interested in through my blog.

## Note:

Its a perpetual work in progress because I like to change up the formatting and themes occasionally and add stuff when necessary.

If you are interested in using this as a starting point for your own website, you are welcome to do so.
Just fork the repo and get editing.
